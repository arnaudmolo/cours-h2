Saifullah, the Australian national, happened to be a guest of Zahirullah, who owned a general store in Mir Ali bazaar, and both were killed.â€™ Our researchers report that there is debate over Zahirullahâ€™s militant links. â€˜There was no doubt about Saifullahâ€™s background. He was a white Australian convert, who had grown a beard and used to rotate between North Waziristan and Khost. Sources said he used to fight against the US-led forces in Khost province in Afghanistan and then return to North Waziristan for rest. Saifullah, in his late 30s, had come to North Waziristan four years ago and had lived in Miramshah and other places. In North Waziristan, he was aligned with the Pakistani Taliban militant group headed by Hafiz Gul Bahadur, who signed a peace agreement with the Pakistan government twice in recent years. He had reportedly come from Khost two days before he was killed.â€™
